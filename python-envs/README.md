# Python Environments

This folder contains a set of Open-AI-gym Python Environments for interfacing with the emulated infrastructures and for generating correlated simulations.
The Python environments expose MDP/POMDP interfaces to emulated infrastructures that can be used to optimize policies for autonomous controllers.

- **Common** [common](./common):
    - Contains common functionality to all python environments
    
- **Minigames** [minigames](./minigames):
    - Implements minigame interfaces to different emulations
    
- **Supergames** [supergames](./supergames):
    - Implements supergame interfaces to different emulations
