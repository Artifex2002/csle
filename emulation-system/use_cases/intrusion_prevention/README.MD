# Network Intrusion Prevention Mini-Games

This folder contains a set of emulated environments for different intrusion 
prevention scenarios (so called "minigames"). 
The environments (cyber ranges/emulations) can be used to 
train/evaluate automatic controllers or reinforcement learning agents on
attack/defense tasks related to network intrusion. 


- [x] Capture the flag [./ctf](minigames/ctf)
    - Several CTF's with varying difficulty are implemented, see: [level_1](minigames/ctf/001/level_1), [level_2](minigames/ctf/001/level_2), [level_3](minigames/ctf/001/level_3), [level_4](minigames/ctf/001/level_4), [level_5](minigames/ctf/001/level_5), [level_6](minigames/ctf/001/level_6), [level_7](minigames/ctf/001/level_7), [random](minigames/ctf/001/random), [./random_many](minigames/ctf/001/random_many)
- [ ] MITM [./mitm](./mitm)
    - Not yet implemented
