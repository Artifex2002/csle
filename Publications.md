ABSTRACT="We present a method to automatically find security strategies for the use
case of intrusion prevention. Following this method, we model the
interaction between an attacker and a defender as a Markov game and let
attack and defense strategies evolve through reinforcement learning and
self-play without human intervention. Using a simple infrastructure
configuration, we demonstrate that effective security strategies can emerge
from self-play. This shows that self-play, which has been applied in other
domains with great success, can be effective in the context of network
security. Inspection of the converged policies show that the emerged
policies reflect common-sense knowledge and are similar to strategies of
humans. Moreover, we address known challenges of reinforcement learning in
this domain and present an approach that uses function approximation, an
opponent pool, and an autoregressive policy representation. Through
evaluations we show that our method is superior to two baseline methods but
that policy convergence in self-play remains a challenge."

ABSTRACT="We study automated intrusion prevention using reinforcement learning. In a novel approach, we formulate the problem of intrusion prevention as an optimal stopping problem. This formulation allows us insight into the structure of the optimal policies, which turn out to be threshold based. Since the computation of the optimal defender policy using dynamic programming is not feasible for practical cases, we approximate the optimal policy through reinforcement learning in a simulation environment. To define the dynamics of the simulation, we emulate the target infrastructure and collect measurements. Our evaluations show that the learned policies are close to optimal and that they indeed can be expressed using thresholds."
