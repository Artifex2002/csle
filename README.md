# What is the Cyber Security Learning Environment (CSLE)?

CSLE is a platform for evaluating and developing reinforcement learning agents for control problems in cyber security.
It can be considered as a cyber range specifically designed for reinforcement learning agents. Everything from network
emulation, to simulation and implementation of network commands have been co-designed to provide an environment where it
is possible to train and evaluate reinforcement learning agents on practical problems in cyber security.
