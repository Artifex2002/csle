        <h2 class="display text-left">What is CSLE?</h2>
        <p>
            CSLE is a framework for evaluating and developing reinforcement learning agents for
            control problems in cyber security. It can be considered as a cyber range specifically designed for
            reinforcement learning agents. Everything from network emulation, to simulation and implementation
            of network commands have been co-designed to provide an environment where it is possible to train and
            evaluate reinforcement learning agents on practical problems in cyber security.

            Main features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="boldTxt">Emulation system:</span>
                CLSE includes a system for emulating large scale IT infrastructures, cyber attacks, and client populations.
                It is based on Linux containers and can be used to collect traces and to evaluate security policies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="boldTxt">Simulation system:</span>
                CSLE includes a simulation system for executing reinforcement learning algorithms
                and simulating Markov decision processes and Markov games. It is built in Python and can be integrated
                with standard machine learning libraries.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="boldTxt">Management system:</span>
                CSLE includes a system for managing emulations and simulations which can be accessed either through a REST API
                or through a web interface. The management system allows a) to start/stop emulations/simulations;
                b) real-time monitoring of emulation and simulation processes; and c), shell access to components of emulations.
            </li>

        <h2 class="display text-left">Why CSLE?</h2>
        <p>
            An organization’s security strategy has traditionally been defined, implemented, and updated by domain
            experts.
            Although this approach can provide basic security for an organization’s communication and computing
            infrastructure,
            a growing concern is that infrastructure update cycles become shorter and attacks increase in
            sophistication.
            Consequently, the security requirements become increasingly difficult to meet. To address this challenge,
            significant efforts have
            started to automate security frameworks and the process of obtaining effective security policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach to approximate optimal control
            strategies in non-trivial scenarios, and fundamental breakthroughs demonstrated by systems like AlphaGo
            and OpenAI Five have inspired us and other researchers to study reinforcement learning with the goal
            to automate security functions. While several encouraging results have been obtained following this
            approach, key challenges remain.
            The main challenge is to narrow the gap between the environment where strategies are evaluated and
            a scenario playing out in a real system. Most of the results obtained so far are limited to abstract
            simulation environments and it is not clear how the results transfer to practical infrastructures. To
            address this
            challenge, we developed CSLE, which is a framework that allows using reinforcement learning to optimize
            security
            policies based on real system data and allows to evaluate learned strategies in practical IT
            infrastructures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, efforts to build similar frameworks as CSLE has started (see
            <a href="https://github.com/Limmen/awesome-rl-for-cybersecurity">survey</a>). Most notably, there is
            <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CyberBattleSim">CyberBattleSim</a> by Microsoft,
            <a href="https://github.com/cage-challenge/CybORG">CyBorg</a> by
            the Australian department of defence, <a href="https://github.com/dstl/YAWNING-TITAN">Yawning Titan</a> by
            the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), and
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07583.pdf">FARLAND</a>
            developed at USA's National Security Agency (NSA). Some of these frameworks only include
            simulation components and some of them include both simulation and emulation components.

            In contrast to these frameworks, CSLE is fully open-source,
            includes both a simulation component and an emulation component,
            and has demonstrated the capabilitiy to learn near-optimal defender strategies on specific use cases
            (see <a href="publications">publications</a>).

            <p>
                The CSLE framework for automating the process of obtaining effective security policies includes three
                parts:
                (1) an emulation system that emulates the target system and is used to evaluate defender strategies
                obtained from self-play;
                (2) a system identification method that produces a model of the target system based on measurements from
                the digital twin;
                and (3) a simulation environment that efficiently executes the self-play process using reinforcement
                learning
                techniques to obtain near optimal defender strategies.

            <h3 class="text-center emulationText">Emulation System</h3>
            <p>
                The emulation system allows emulating large scale IT infrastructures and network traffic,
                i.e client traffic, cyber attacks, and automated defenses.
                It executes on a cluster of machines that runs a virtualization layer provided by Docker containers
                and virtual links. It implements network isolation and traffic shaping on the containers using
                network namespaces and the NetEm module in the Linux kernel. Resource constraints of the containers,
                e.g. CPU and memory constraints, are enforced using cgroups.

            <p>
                The simulation system of CSLE allows running reinforcement learning and optimization algorithms
                to learn security strategies. Formally, we model the interaction between an attacker and
                a defender as a Markov game. We then use simulations of self-play where autonomous agents interact and
                continuously update their strategies based on experience from previously played games.
                To automatically update strategies in the game, several methods can be used,
                including computational game theory, dynamic programming, evolutionary algorithms, and reinforcement
                learning.
